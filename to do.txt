purge local storage and cache button top right (resets favorites? (not sure if possible to keep them) and fetches the site new) = trashcan 
batlogo still not appearing (very essential)
favorite function works on everything not just the generated buttons
add footer
force the page to be horizontal always (make them bitches turn their phones)
when reloading the page the favorited buttons appear on every slide until you click or navigate to the star after that it fixes itself
arrows broken
show on which slide you are in the pagination and subpagination

maybe:
it should choose by itelf how many buttons fit on the screen instead of forcing it to have a set amount

very maybe:
somehow add a tagging system
change webhook interface
