Add permanent skip and stop buttons top left (audio symbols) (should just send !skip !stop)
purge local storage and cache button top right = trashcan 
batlogo still not appearing (very essential)
favorite function works on everything not just the generated buttons
<sup> for stuff somehow not working
favorite function to "special"
add footer
make it work on mobile (scaling is completly broken)
if there are multiple pages for a letter it would be nice to have buttons (empty circles) at the bottom of the slide to navigate to the others (full circle showing where you are)
it should choose by itelf how many buttons fit on the screen instead of forcing it to have 20

very maybe:
somehow add a tagging system
