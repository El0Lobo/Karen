***Stuff I need to do in "bestversionyet" to final version:***

 · all buttons should be the same size
 · if there are few buttons the padding gets less, no idea why it should always be the same.
 · get mute button to work ,got it working in Karen_Web_Manager_fixed(1) cant move it though.
 · add animation on button press (from spinning and pulsating) same deal.
 · add numbers tab to pagination for sounds with numbers as name to the end of the pagination.
 · add perma stop button bottom left (!stop)
 · add webhook from Karen_Web_Manager_fixed(1).
 · make verything scale the right way depending on screensize 
 optional: 
  · add a favorite page and make it so that sounds that are favorited (in the best case by clicking a icon ,that fills its color out or     something or checkmark thingy) are copied there and dissapear when defavorited. (and a way to store this information either in the     html itself or if hosted on github somehow there? Cookies/Local Storage API)
  · make it compatible for vertical use
